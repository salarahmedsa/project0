# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The website's main page is index.html, remaining three html files are connected with it. I've used three buttons for navigation, by clicking them you can visit those pages. Every page, excluding the main page, has a back to home link at the bottom through which we can go back to the main page directly.

My website's topic is COVID-19 so the data for the site has been taken from wikipedia and who.int and mostly been rephrased.

The project contains four html files,one image that is used in the site. Two stylesheets one is .scss and other is converted to .css.
